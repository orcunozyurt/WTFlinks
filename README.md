# WTFlinks
WTFlinks is a browser extension that helps you to see the contents of shared links in your feed.

A lot of news agencies and other websites are trying to capture your attention with "clickbait" titles. This way they make sure you visit their website to get the details of those particular news. WTFlinks makes it easier for you to see the contents of those links right on your feed without being redirected to another website.

Planned to work best with Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin feeds.
